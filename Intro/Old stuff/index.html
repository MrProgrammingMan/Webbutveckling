      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Chivalry 2</h3>
      <p>Chivalry 2 is a 2021 first-third person, multiplayer slasher inspired by the epic medieval movie battles.
        Players are thrust into the action of every iconic moment of the era - from clashing swords, to storms of
        flaming arrows, to sprawling castle sieges and more. It has a revamped, faster and more fluid combat system
        offers an expanded range of creative choices, allowing players to perfect their playstyle. Immersive sound and
        effects ensure every blow lands with the sickening thud of steel sinking into bone. The sequel to Chivalry:
        Medieval Warfare (2012), the game was released on June 8, 2021, for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
        One and Xbox Series X and Series S.

        The dueling factions of Chivalry are the Agatha Knights and Mason Order. Both factions are native to Agatha.
        Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is set in the first civil war, showing the Mason Order's aggressive takeover of the
        country. Chivalry 2 is set in the second civil war, with the Agatha Knights now positioned as the rebels.
        A third faction, the Tenosian Empire was added to Chivalry 2 in the Tenosian Invasion update.

        <p>The Agathian Knights were forged when King Argon I of Olde Agatha united the fractured kingdoms during the
          Unification War. Their leadership is dominated by the nobility of Agatha, particularly wealthy families from
          the prosperous provinces. They are deeply religious, with a strong sense of birthright, loyalty, and honor.
          Their love of justice, wealth, and beauty drives them toward both greatness and folly.

          Agatha, led by Steward King Feydrid Kearn, was utterly crushed by the Mason Order at the conclusion of the
          Civil War (Chivalry I). Now, twenty years later, they return under the banner of the self-proclaimed "King of
          Agatha," King Argon II.

          Having recently suffered defeat at the hands of a ruthless enemy, there is a growing desire to cast aside the
          mercies once shown by their adversaries.

        <p>The Mason Order was founded by the rebellious General Malric following the death of King Argon I during the
          Crusade. The formation of the Order led to the First Civil War, from which, after much bloodshed and a
          grueling siege, the Masons emerged victorious. With the Kingdom now firmly under his control, Malric sought to
          rebuild his army and establish the undeniable legitimacy of his rule.

          The core values of the Mason Order—strength, discipline, and ferocity—are the driving forces behind everything
          they do. The humiliation of defeat at the hands of the foreign Tenosians fueled Malric's desire to reshape the
          lands and people of Agatha into a harder, stronger force. The commoners who suffered most under his rule have
          become his most fervent supporters, for those among them who consider themselves strong are willing to pay any
          price for the chance to rise above the crushing constraints of birthright and piety.

          Now, after twenty years, the Agathians return. Malric welcomes the battles to come with the full might of the
          Mason Order.

        <p>​Tenosia, the mysterious lands to the south, have long loomed as a distant threat over the kingdom of Agatha.
          This menace emerged after the failed Crusade that resulted in the death of King Argon I, igniting the civil
          war between the Mason Order and the Agathian Knights. The Tenosian Empire is a sophisticated and academic
          culture that enjoyed long periods of peace before the invasion of the first Crusades. That tranquility was
          shattered when war came to their shores from the barbarians to the north. For the past twenty years, they have
          meticulously plotted their retaliation. Built on harsh, arid lands, the Tenosians have adapted with remarkable
          engineering, innovative city planning, and an advanced understanding of the stars, leaving their lands
          prosperous and rich.

          Now, under the fierce leadership of Myah Vane, known as "The Tigress," the Tenosians strike at Baudwyn's
          Bulwark, the ancient fortress that has for centuries stood as the barrier between the two empires. Whispers of
          devastating new technology threaten this enduring stronghold, and if it falls, Agatha will burn and suffer
          beneath the vengeful might of the Tenosian Empire. With Agatha and the Mason Order locked in civil war, the
          Tenosians see the perfect opportunity to conquer the fertile lands of Agatha and exact their long-awaited
          vengeance for the failed Crusade two decades ago. Baudwyn's Bulwark is only the beginning.
